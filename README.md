#UdacityDA_Investigate-Weather-Trends
The initial, small project submitted as part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree


### Dataset:
* Global temperatures & London temperatures

### Aim of the project:

To provide a simple introduction into the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. The purpose of this introductory project was to compare the temperatures of a chosen city with the global temperatures.

I computed the 7-day and 14-day moving averages of the temperatures then compared the two findings.

Additionally created a correlation coefficient between them.
