# udacity_DS_project_WeatherTrends
The initial, small project submitted as part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree


### Dataset:
* Global temperatures & London temperatures

### Aim of the project:

To provide a simple introduction into the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. The scope of this introductory project was to compare the temepartures of a chosen city with the global temperatures.

I computed the 7day and 14day moving averages of the temperatures then compared the two findings.

I also created a correlation coefficient between them.
